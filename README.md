Accelerator Things adds four new kinds of accelerators:

- The Triaccelerator splits any objects going through the accelerator path into two separate paths
- The Upccelerator fires things up at an incline
- The Vaccelerator projects a vac stream to vac items off the ground or out of storage
- The Accelefilter has a customizable filter that will let you fire specific objects onto a separate path

All accelerator variants are unlocked when the accelerator is unlocked.

This mod is built via [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/) and thus requires it to work
