Accelerator Things adds five new kinds of accelerators:

- The Triaccelerator splits any objects going through the accelerator path into two separate paths
- The Upccelerator fires things up at an incline
- The Vaccelerator projects a vac stream to vac items off the ground or out of storage
- The Accelefilter has a customizable filter that will let you fire specific objects onto a separate path
- The Bigccelerator allows you to launch large objects, including the player

All accelerator variants are able to be purchased from the ProntoMart as soon as the accelerator is unlocked.

This mod is built via [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/) and thus requires it to work
